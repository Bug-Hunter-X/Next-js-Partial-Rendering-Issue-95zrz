# Next.js Partial Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a peculiar bug in Next.js where a component only partially renders.  Some elements are displayed correctly, while others are completely missing from the DOM, with no errors appearing in the console.

## Bug Description

The `About` page only displays the first paragraph. The second paragraph `<p>This should render fine.</p>` does not appear in the browser despite no apparent errors. This issue occurs inconsistently and appears to relate to the component's structure, not a specific code error.
